The idea is to use the expression [*] to fetch the IPs of all:

output "pip_address" {
  value = azurerm_public_ip.example[*].ip_address
}

Which gives us as a result:

Changes to Outputs:
  + pip_address = [
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply),
    ]

And after the apply:

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

pip_address = [
  "20.42.47.176",
  "172.173.166.249",
  "4.246.220.2",
]

Without the use of [*] the system gets confused and doesn’t give us the requested output:

Error: Missing resource instance key
│
│   on main.tf line 16, in output "pip_address":
│   16:    value = azurerm_public_ip.example.ip_address
│
│ Because azurerm_public_ip.example has "count" set, its attributes must be accessed on specific instances.
│
│ For example, to correlate with indices of a referring resource, use:
│     azurerm_public_ip.example[count.index]
